# React Component Generator
React Component Generator is small app that generate the struture of files of React component.

As front-end developer, when i have structure of React component that i must follow to my project. That's why React Component Generator give me the possibility to do it without creating files.

> 💁  The structure is some how old, it generate index file with connect decorator of React-redux which is old way to connect with the component. Because it's created in 2019!

Before to try it, you must have `node.js` installed in your computer. Now, you can download the code or clone it and start by install the dependecies by:

```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn install
```

to use command `generate-rc`, you must link by executing this command:
```
sudo npm link
```

or, just by running the start command:
```
npm run start
```
or
```
yarn run start
```

Enjoy
